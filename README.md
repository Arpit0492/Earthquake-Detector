# Earthquake-Detector
An interactive graphical application in java 
unfolding_app_template
==================================================================

This is a skeleton to use Unfolding in Eclipse as well as some starter
code for the Object Oriented Programming in Java.

A very basic Unfolding demo you'll find in the source folder in the default package. 
For more examples visit http://unfoldingmaps.org, or download the template with
examples.
•	Title of the Project : Earthquake Detecting Application
•	Objective : To develop a software application which will detect the earthquakes around the world and showcase their strengths on                     various parameters.
•	Hardware and Software : Eclipse IDE, Java, SQLite library, Unfolding Maps library, Processing library for Java.
                          Requirement.

•	Problem Statement	 : 
We are living in a time where Natural disasters are happening much more frequently than ever before, and earthquakes are the most catastrophic ones. There is not much user friendly earthquake detecting applications available on web.
While this project focuses on making use of the real life data information and showcasing it to the user by providing easy to read, understandable keys of a recent live earthquake.

•	Methodology		 : 
The aim is to develop an interactive graphical application in java which will make use of OOP paradigms, Java GUI, Event handlers, searching and sorting algorithms to manage large data sets. In this project Unfolding Maps library will be used as a foundation for depicting interactive maps and geo-visualizations. While the large data sets are going to be extracted using a live Earthquake feed database by http://earthquake.usgs.gov/.

INSTALLATION

Import this folder in Eclipse ('File' -> 'Import' -> 'Existing Projects into
Workspace', Select this folder, 'Finish')


MANUAL INSTALLATION

If the import does not work follow the steps below.

- Create new Java project
- Copy+Paste all files into project
- Add all lib/*.jars to build path
- Set native library location for jogl.jar. Choose appropriate folder for your OS.
- Add data/ as src


TROUBLE SHOOTING

Switch Java Compiler to 1.6 if you get VM problems. (Processing should work with Java 1.6, and 1.7)
